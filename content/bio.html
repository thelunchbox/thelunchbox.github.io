I'm originally from Troy, Ohio, a small town north of Dayton. I spent my entire
childhood there until I made my way to Columbus to attend Ohio State in 2004. I
have always been inquisitive and creative, and I've been drawing and making up
games for as long as I can remember. At Ohio State, I met my better half Lisa
during some late-night shifts working the front desk of Taylor Tower. I
graduated from OSU in 2008 and we were later married in 2011. We have three cats
who are a constant source of affection, entertainment, and scratches. We
are avid fans of the Columbus Blue Jackets and pizza. In my spare time, I like
to work on side projects, play video games, play lots of sports like
<a target="_blank" href="http://chadminton.net">chadminton</a>, ball hockey, and
basketball, and occassionally I like to throw on an apron and hop into the
kitchen to try making something new, like homemade pasta or dumplings.
