I am an engineering leader with {{new Date().getFullYear() - 2008}} years of
engineering experience and {{new Date().getFullYear() - 2017}} years of
leadership experience. I am not a <i>heads down</i> type of engineer - I prefer
tinkering and iterating while frequently collaborating with others. I have a
passion for building things and take a breadth-first approach to engineering. I
love to consider the big picture and focus on long-term goals. As a leader, I
have two basic philosophies. First, I try to lead with humility. I don't
consider myself to be more important or above the rest of the team because I
don't feel that I am. The engineers doing the work are the most important part
of the team and I do my very best to show them that I believe that's true. I
lead with humor and want everyone on the team to truly care about one another -
I've found that's the most effective way to get people to stay accountable to
one another. Second, I try to lead by example. I don't ask anyone to do
something that I wouldn't be willing to do myself, and I try not to delegate
busy work. Instead, I treat leadership as a service that I provide to the team.
My role is to fill gaps and pick up slack to ensure that the team can meet the
goals we've set. And while I have a wealth of experience, I'm well aware that I
can still learn a lot from the team and I don't shy away from letting them know
that. As an engineer, I built my own video game from scratch using Javascript,
that was quite an adventure. For better or worse, I never accept things at face
value; I am profoundly driven by wanting to know <i>how</i> things work and how
I could build things myself. I consider frameworks to be guidelines, not
paradigms. I tend towards building things from scratch because I love knowing
how something works from front to back. In fact, this website was built
<i>mostly</i> from scratch. The front-end is vanilla javascript, html, and css.
For some reason, I just like doing things myself.
