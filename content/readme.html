<h2>Guide</h2>
<div>
  This is my README, a document that helps introduce you to my working style,
  philosophy, and expectations. The intended audience is primarily anyone who I
  work with on a recurring basis. Please treat it as a reference and promise on
  how I will conduct myself. I urge you to hold me accountable to my promises,
  and to call out anything that might be missing from this document.
</div>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<div>
  I don't take myself too seriously and I genuinely just want to help all of you
  in any way I can.
</div>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<div>
  My name is Alex Merkert. I am not a heads down type of engineer - I prefer
  tinkering and iterating while frequently collaborating with others. I have a
  passion for building things from scratch (often when it doesn't make sense)
  and take a breadth-first approach to engineering. I love to consider the big
  picture and focus on long-term goals. As a result of that, I'm also not as
  attentive to the details, so I may not always catch every nuance.
</div>

<div>
  I don't consider myself to be more important or above the rest of the team -
  the engineers doing the work are the most important part of the team and I do
  my very best to show them that I believe that's true. I try to lead with humor
  and want everyone on the team to truly care about one another - I've found
  that will lead to everyone being accountable to one another. I also try to
  lead by example. I don't ask anyone to do something that I wouldn't be willing
  to do myself, and I try not to delegate busy work. I feel that my leadership
  is a service that I provide to the team. My role is to find ways to ensure
  that the team can meet the goals we've set. I'm well aware that I can still
  learn a lot from the team and I don't shy away from letting them know that.
</div>

<div>
  As an engineer, I built my own video game from scratch using Javascript - that
  was quite an adventure. For better or worse, I never accept things at face
  value; I am profoundly driven by wanting to know how things work and how I
  could build things myself. I consider frameworks to be guidelines, not
  paradigms. I tend towards building things from scratch because I love knowing
  how something works from front to back.
</div>

<h2>What, exactly, would you say you <i>DO</i> here?</h2>
<div>
  My primary job is to make other people better and more effective at their job.
  That could be through coaching or it could be via partnering, but either way,
  I feel most effective when I can superpower others. I also occasionally act as
  a technical consultant, but that's simply to facilitate conversation, and I
  will look to the seasoned engineers on the team to provide technical details
  (remember, I'm bad at those).
</div>
<div>
  Some ways I want to be of service to my teams
  <ol>
    <li>
      Remove blockers or bottlenecks - I want to make sure you can do your job
      and you feel effective
    </li>
    <li>
      Listen and gather feedback - I help you best when I know what you need
    </li>
    <li>
      Be a human router - sharing information, making sure that people that need
      to talk come together, and making connections
    </li>
    <li>
      Develop and refine processes - sometimes it's better when we have a set of
      agreed-upon rules to follow
    </li>
    <li>
      Advocate - I want to make sure that you're supported in your work and that
      you have everything you need
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<h2>How I communicate and work best</h2>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I am a text book extrovert - I love talking to people and I try to be as
      entertaining as I can to keep people engaged. I tend to like attention a
      little too much, and I have to consciously remind myself to step back at
      times.
    </li>
    <li>
      I love to collaborate, and I work best when we can talk through things and
      piggy-back off of each other. I say dumb things out loud and don't feel
      embarrassed by it, and I firmly believe there are no bad ideas in
      brainstorming.
    </li>
    <li>
      I want your feedback, and I need it to make sure I'm not doing anything
      that really bothers or disrupts you. Don't wait 3 months to tell me that
      I've been spelling your name wrong - I want to correct things as soon as
      possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm a visual person - I like charts, diagrams, and spreadsheets. I abuse
      Google Sheets in ways that make most people physically ill.
    </li>
    <li>
      As a consequence of ^^that^^ I also tend to make weird analogies a lot -
      like, our database is a car, and we don't have all the tools to fix
      everything about our car, that's why we have to work with the mechanics
      over in Data Ops... so if you're willing to go on those journeys with me,
      you'll usually find my point somewhere in there.
    </li>
    <li>
      I tend to multi-task fairly well but I occasionally need reminders to
      circle back to something. I always have two or three things going on in my
      brain at once, but if you can get my attention (try jingling keys in front
      of me) I can mute the other things to focus with you.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have a tendency at time to take on more than I can handle - if you see
      me doing that, a rolled-up newspaper or a spritz of water can help correct
      me. I do really love to be involved with things though, so you'll see me
      pop up in a lot of places.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Things you can expect from me</h2>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I believe in working hard and playing hard - when it's time to get down to
      business, we'll make sure to get things done the right way, and when it's
      time to goof off, no expense is spared in coming up with new a Zoom
      background
    </li>
    <li>
      I will always make time for you. I may not be able to respond right away
      but if you message me, I'll get back to you pretty quickly and if it's
      urgent or important, I will make sure to make you a priority.
    </li>
    <li>
      I do not have all the answers - sometimes I might throw something out or
      ask a question but it's only in service of starting (or progressing) a
      conversation. I am shamelessly open with my ideas (as I said above) so
      please don't take anything I say as an order. I want to challenge you but
      I'm also happy to be challenged.
    </li>
    <li>
      If something urgently needs to get done or is a priority, I will get it
      done. I do whatever is required and will not stop until the task is
      complete - and if I don't know how to proceed, I don't sit around and wait
      - I will find the right person to help me.
    </li>
    <li>
      You'll experience a lot of my self-deprecation - don't fight it, it's just
      a coping mechanism I used to deal with my impostor syndrome ðŸ™ƒ
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Ask me about</h2>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Sports I guess? Not a super popular topic among engineers sometimes but I
      love to play sports (mostly Basketball, Ball Hockey, and a sport of my own
      that I invented called Chadminton) as well as watch sports (Ohio State
      Football/Basketball, Columbus Blue Jackets, Philadelphia Eagles, and
      Cincinnati Reds)
    </li>
    <li>
      Video game development - as I mentioned, I wrote my own game called
      Spinball (hmm, I really like inventing new games)
    </li>
    <li>
      Graphic Design - especially logos, I'm a pretty big logo nerd and I love
      designing logos as a hobby - also usually sports logos, for Chadminton...
      I might need some new hobbies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Music - I'm not a huge music nerd or anything but lately it's been more on
      my mind and I've started dabbling in making my own music electronically. I
      can't really play any instruments very well, although I can make
      not-terrible-sounds on guitars and pianos with some practice and
      tinkering, but I'm more experimental and like self-teaching in general.
    </li>
    <li>
      Anything else, really - I enjoy forming immediate opinions on things
      simply to have interesting conversations. There are things I don't have
      any interest in, like country music or discussing cars, but if you're
      excited to talk about it, I'd ask you plenty of questions.
    </li>
  </ul>
